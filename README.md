Test your skills: Overflow-Task One

The content is overflowing the box because it has a fixed height. Keep the height but cause the box to have scrollbars only if there is enough text to cause an overflow. Test by removing some of the text from the HTML, that if there is only a small amount of text that does not overflow, no scrollbar appears.
